If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\n  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\n  propTypes: {\n    beforeStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n    afterStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n    beforeElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n    afterElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n    elementType: React.PropTypes.string\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      beforeElementType: 'div',\n      afterElementType: 'div',\n      elementType: 'div'\n    };\n  },\n\n  render: function render() {\n    var _props = this.props;\n    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n    var beforeElement = undefined,\n        afterElement = undefined;\n\n    beforeStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n    afterStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n\n    if (this.props.beforeStyle) beforeElement = React.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(beforeStyle, this.props.beforeStyle),\n      key: \"::before\"\n    });\n    if (this.props.afterStyle) afterElement = React.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(afterStyle, this.props.afterStyle),\n      key: \"::after\"\n    });\n\n    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n    var props = other;\n    props.style = this.props.style;\n\n    return React.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n  }\n\n});\n\nmodule.exports = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/material-ui/lib/before-after-wrapper.js\n ** module id = 256\n ** module chunks = 1\n **/\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/material-ui/lib/before-after-wrapper.js\n ** module id = 256\n ** module chunks = 1\n **/","'use strict';\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(obj, keys) { var target = {}; for (var i in obj) { if (keys.indexOf(i) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, i)) continue; target[i] = obj[i]; } return target; }\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar Paper = require('../paper');\nvar StylePropable = require('../mixins/style-propable');\nvar CardExpandable = require('./card-expandable');\n\nvar Card = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'Card',\n\n  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return { expanded: this.props.initiallyExpanded ?
